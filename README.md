### Hi there, I'm TomasðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior analytics engineer. I mainly write code with SQL and Python, occasionally I do HTML, and currently I am learning more about Python and machine learning.

Here is some of the stuff I enjoy doing:
* Time series analysis and forecasting
* Work with data and APIs
* Code with SQL and Python
* Data visualization

**tomassidiskis/TomasSidiskis** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
